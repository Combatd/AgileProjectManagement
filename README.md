# AgileProjectManagement
Agile Software Development Process

* Task Board is a familiar practice in Waterfall, Scrum, XP
* Emphasize cross-functional teams over knowledge silos
* Scrum terms often get used in Agile

* Agile emphasizes individuals over processes and tools
* More face to face interaction

## Roles in a Team
* It is difficult to think of roles without understanding Agile Mindset
* Agile roles are often different than traditional roles
* Agile is radically different than how most organizations operate
  * People may not be performing their duties the same way
* A Scrum Master is different than a project manager
  * Coaching
  * Encouraging responsibility
  * Facilitate self-management
  * Administrative worker
  * Trainer or Coach
  * "Bulldoze" obstacles
  * "Shield" from outside interference
  * Conflict Negotiation
  * May start out mostly training others, then over time they spend more time on adminstration
  * They can tell Management and others how their actions affect the team and interfere with product delivery
  * Spend most of your time serving others
* Product Owner
  * Works with the team to deliver product
  * Shared responsibility with product owner and team
  * Should have authority to make real-time decisions
  * Sits with the team and answers all questions
* Product Manager
  * Product Strategy
  * Once vision is created, they bring Product Owner in
  * A product backlog is a list of features that could be added to product
  * A customer representative is needed in the Agile team

* If there is no Product Owner, the software developers may just start finishing the easiest features first
  * Not always maximum value

* Scrum Master Certifications are far and wide, more than others - very interested role
* Pulling someone off an Agile team bottlenecks their work
* Communication and Cross-Functional Teams is related
* Groupthink: Everyone just goes along with the experts of a group without asking questions
* In Agile, if you can't explain to the others, it may be a bad idea

## Challenging Changes
* If you have people doing the same things just with Agile role names, it isn't working
* Like Yoga...if you are doing it right, it hurts just a bit (a little bit anxious)
* Step away from long-term detailed plans and inspect/adapt
* Comfort with uncertainty is a competitive advantage
* Business Analysts should not handing off requirements to the team
* Eliminate handoffs - An agile team mixes up the lines of responsibility
* Working software as status updates, each sprint is to an iteration of a working ready to ship product
* A lot of Agile transformations fail before really starting due to an organizational culture that dislikes changes
